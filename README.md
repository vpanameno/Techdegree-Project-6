# Techdegree-Project-6

In this project, I created a portfolio that details my last few projects. We used Node.js, Express and npm to create this project.
I learned a lot about Middleware and a LOT about errors that need to be displayed in a friendly way to have a better experience for your user.
I am going for exceeds so I will detail the changes I made to the CSS.

Changes in CSS:

- changed the background color in the body
- changed the shadow boxes from 1px->3pm in my project images
- changed the font for all of my headers
